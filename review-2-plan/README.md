## üìä Understanding the Results

### Normal Operation

```
[12345] RMS: X=1.23 Y=1.45 Z=1.67 mg | Temp: 24.5 24.7 24.3 ¬∞C

Healthy Indicators:
‚úì RMS levels stable (¬±20% variation)
‚úì Temperature within operating range (0-50¬∞C)
‚úì Dominant frequency constant (¬±1%)
‚úì Kurtosis near 3.0
```

### Anomaly Detected

```
*** ANOMALY DETECTED ***
[X] RMS 1.82√ó baseline! [Y] Freq shift 3.2%!
************************

Potential Causes:
‚ö†Ô∏è RMS increase: New vibration source, crack opening/closing
‚ö†Ô∏è Frequency shift: Stiffness loss, structural damage
‚ö†Ô∏è High kurtosis (>5): Early fault, localized defect
‚Üí RECOMMEND: Visual inspection of structure
```

### What to Do

| Alert Type | Severity | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Single spike | Low | Monitor, likely transient event |
| Recurring pattern | Medium | Check for new vibration sources (HVAC, equipment) |
| Persistent shift | High | Schedule professional inspection |
| Multiple indicators | Critical | Immediate visual inspection required |

## üìà Performance Specifications

### Detection Capabilities

| Parameter | Consumer Sensors | Professional | This System |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Noise Floor** | 15 mg | 0.05 mg | **0.75-1.5 mg** ‚úì |
| **Frequency Accuracy** | ¬±5% | ¬±0.01% | **¬±1%** ‚úì |
| **Temperature Drift** | ¬±35 mg | ¬±0.5 mg | **¬±2-3 mg** ‚úì |
| **Dynamic Range** | 60 dB | 140 dB | **80 dB** ‚úì |
| **Cost** | $20 | $500-5000 | **$50-80** ‚úì |

### What This System CAN Detect

‚úÖ **Frequency shifts >1%** (stiffness loss, damage)  
‚úÖ **RMS changes >150%** (crack propagation, settlement)  
‚úÖ **Visible cracks** (>1-2mm width)  
‚úÖ **Foundation settlement** (large-scale tilting)  
‚úÖ **Post-earthquake damage** (structural period lengthening)  
‚úÖ **Major structural changes** (visible deterioration)

### What This System CANNOT Detect

‚ùå **Micro-cracks** (<0.5mm width)  
‚ùå **Ambient vibration modes** (<0.1 mg)  
‚ùå **Slow degradation** (creep, corrosion) without clear frequency shift  
‚ùå **High-frequency damage** (>100 Hz) reliably  
‚ùå **Localized defects** without dense sensor placement

**Bottom Line:** This system provides **80-90% of professional capability for 1-5 story residential/commercial buildings** at 2% of the cost. Perfect for early warning and trend monitoring, but not suitable for precision damage quantification or regulatory compliance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

### Safety & Liability

**This system is for MONITORING ONLY, not life-safety applications:**

- ‚ùå NOT suitable for critical infrastructure (bridges, dams, nuclear)
- ‚ùå NOT for regulatory compliance or building code enforcement
- ‚ùå NOT a replacement for professional structural inspections
- ‚ùå NOT suitable for seismic early warning systems

**Intended Use:**
- ‚úÖ Early warning for residential/small commercial buildings
- ‚úÖ Research and educational purposes
- ‚úÖ Long-term trend monitoring and maintenance planning
- ‚úÖ Proof-of-concept before professional system deployment

### Limitations

1. **Detection Threshold:** Cannot detect damage below 2-3mg vibration amplitude
2. **False Positives:** 1-5% rate - not all alerts indicate actual damage
3. **False Negatives:** May miss slow degradation processes (creep, corrosion)
4. **Temperature Dependence:** Requires calibration for >20¬∞C variations
5. **Installation Quality:** Performance critically depends on rigid mounting

### Recommendations

- Use as **screening tool** to identify when professional inspection needed
- Combine with **regular visual inspections** (quarterly)
- Establish **clear escalation protocols** for anomaly alerts
- **Recalibrate sensors** every 3-6 months
- Consider **hybrid approach** (professional + consumer sensors) for critical buildings

### Maintenance Schedule

```
