## 🎯 What Happens Next?

### First Hour: Validation
```
Leave system running on desk/table
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Monitor Serial Output:          │
│ [100] RMS: X=2.3 Y=1.8 Z=2.1 mg │
│ Temp: 24.5 24.7 24.3 °C         │
│                                 │
│ Should be steady, low noise     │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

Verify:
✓ All 3 sensors responding
✓ RMS levels 2-5 mg (normal desk vibration)
✓ Temperature readings make sense
✓ No error messages
```

### First Day: Baseline
```
Mount on structure (epoxy/fasteners)
↓
Let cure 24 hours if using epoxy
↓
System automatically establishes baseline:
- Normal vibration levels
- Dominant frequencies
- Temperature patterns
- Daily cycles
↓
Ready for monitoring!
```

### First Week: Monitoring
```
System now detecting anomalies:

Normal Operation:
[1234] RMS: X=1.2 Y=1.4 Z=1.6 mg ✓

If Anomaly:
*** ANOMALY DETECTED ***
[X] RMS 1.8× baseline!
[Y] Freq shift 2.5%!
→ Check structure
```

### First Month: Analysis
```
Remove SD card
↓
Run: python analyze_data.py
↓
Get comprehensive report:
- Frequency analysis
- Trend detection  
- Anomaly summary
- HTML report with plots
```

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Will this work on my building?
**A:** Best for 1-5 story residential/commercial. Can detect:
- ✅ Major cracks (>1mm)
- ✅ Settlement
- ✅ Frequency shifts >1%
- ❌ Micro-cracks (<0.5mm)
- ❌ Very slow degradation

### Q: How accurate is it?
**A:** With our techniques:
- Noise: 0.75-1.5 mg (was 15 mg)
- Frequency: ±1% (was ±5%)
- Temperature drift: ±2-3 mg (was ±35 mg)

**Comparable to $100-200 professional sensors!**

### Q: Can I use it for my thesis/research?
**A:** Absolutely! This implements peer-reviewed methods:
- Cite: Komarizadehasl et al. (2021) - MDPI Sensors
- Cite: This repository
- See README.md for full references

### Q: Is it safe for critical structures?
**A:** **NO.** This is a monitoring/research tool, not:
- ❌ Life-safety system
- ❌ Regulatory compliance
- ❌ Critical infrastructure
- ❌ Seismic warning

Use for early detection, not as replacement for professional inspection.

### Q: What if I need help?
**A:** Multiple resources:
1. README.md - comprehensive documentation
2. CALIBRATION_GUIDE.md - detailed procedures
3. GitHub Issues - bug reports
4. GitHub Discussions - community help
